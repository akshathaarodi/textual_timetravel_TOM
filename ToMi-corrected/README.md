# Fixed ToMi
----

This repository contains the code to generate the dataset used in our EMNLP 2019 paper: ["Revisiting the Evaluation of Theory of Mind through Question Answering"](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-1598.pdf).  The code is heavily based off of the following [repository](https://github.com/kayburns/tom-qa-dataset) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09352)

## Generating the data

```
pip install tqdm
git clone git@github.com:facebookresearch/ToMi.git
cd ToMi
python main.py
```

This will produce six files in the `data` directory of the repository:

```bash
$ ls data
test.trace  test.txt  train.trace  train.txt  val.trace  val.txt
```

## Data

The data follows the same format and uses the same models as the [`tom-qa-dataset`](https://github.com/kayburns/tom-qa-dataset) repository.  We do include one supplementary file for each `*.txt` file that classifies the story/question type in each example (which contains a `.trace` extension).  Each line in a trace file contains a high level abstraction of the story as well as a classification of the question and a classification of the story.  Story types can be one of:

1. `true_belief` - All agents observed all actions
2. `false_belief` - An agent failed to observe an action
3. `second_order_false_belief` - An agent has a false belief about another agent's set of beliefs
 
Question types can be one of:

1. `first_order_(0|1)_tom` - A first order false belief question in a story where a false belief situaion has been established
2. `first_order_(0|1)_no_tom` - A first order false belief question in a story where the agent in question observed all actions
3. `second_order_(0|1)_tom` - A second order false belief question in a story where a second order false belief situation has been established
4. `second_order_(0|1)_no_tom` - A second order false belief question in a story where the agent in question does not have a second order false belief
8. `reality` - A control question (ex: "Where is object *x* now?")
9. `memory` - A control question (ex: "Where was object *x* at the beginning?")
